# wireframe

a11y component toolkit for the web

## about

`Wireframe` is a set of accessible components based on [ARIA patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/).

It is also a collection of utilities to create performant lightweight web components.

It is also a set of styles for exisiting HTMLElements.

Every step of the process is opt-in and close to bare metal browser stack:
- queue component renders
- add keyboard and pointer interactivity
- ARIA support
- subscribe to state stores

## comments

`Wireframe` is as opinionated as it is compositional. As in, I have some opinions and this library prefers composition to inheritence.
